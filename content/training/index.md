I have been organizing and teaching hands-on courses on data analysis for genomics since 2014. The flagship course I organize and usually teach at, "computational genomics summer school", is announced via the [dedicated course website](http//compgen.mdc-berlin.de). We also announce it in various social media platforms. I'm also working on a [book draft](http://compgenomr.github.io/book) covering various topics related to computational genomics such as domain-specific data analysis and general statistics and machine learning.


In addition to the training efforts, I and my team offer consultation on data analysis related issues to MDC scientists. We have done hundreds of hours consultations and helped researchers with various data analysis related issues. 

## Custom Training & consulting
I offer custom computational genomics & data science training and consultations directed towards industry or other clients via [rolv.io](http://rolv.io). They offer custom training at your location on computational genomics and data science. If you have a specific need in mind, get in touch with [rolv](mailto:info@rolv.io) or you can see the currently offered public courses via [https://www.rolv.io/training](https://www.rolv.io/training)

[rolv.io](http://rolv.io) also offers consultation on **scientific/technical feasibility** and **data analysis strategies**. If interested, check [rolv.io](http://rolv.io) for further info on their solutions.
