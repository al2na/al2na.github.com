I have been organizing and teaching hands-on courses on data analysis for genomics since 2014. The flagship course I organize and usually teach at, "computational genomics summer school", is announced via the [dedicated course website](http://compgen.mdc-berlin.de). We also announce it in various social media platforms. I'm also working on a [book draft](http://compgenomr.github.io/book) covering various topics related to computational genomics such as domain-specific data analysis and general statistics and machine learning.


In addition to the training efforts, I and my team offer consultation on data analysis related issues to MDC scientists. We have done hundreds of hours consultations and helped researchers with various data analysis related issues. 

## Custom  consulting
I offer custom computational genomics & data science training and consultations directed towards industry or other clients. If you are interested get in touch.
